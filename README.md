<h2>Why Go After Bot Lobbies in Fortnite PS5?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Warm up comfortably:</b> Without sweat dripping from every build fight, you can practice edits, builds, and aim with less pressure.</li>
  <li><b>Farm challenges faster:</b> Completing quests, weekly objectives, or Battle Pass milestones gets easier when you‚Äôre not constantly getting third-partied.</li>
  <li><b>Try goofy or new strategies:</b> Wanna drop in less popular spots, use unusual loadouts, or test new tactics? Bot lobbies are perfect for that.</li>
  <li><b>Create content:</b> Whether it‚Äôs clips for TikTok, YouTube, or just to show friends, bot lobbies make montage-worthy moments more doable.</li>
  <li><b>Just relax and have fun:</b> Not every game session needs to be sweaty and stressful. Sometimes you just want a chill build-battle or to mess around.</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally use easier lobbies for all of these reasons. Knowing I can control the difficulty level means more fun and faster progress without burning out.</p>

<h2>What Really Works for Fortnite PS5 Bot Lobbies (and What Doesn‚Äôt)</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs get real: you can‚Äôt simply flip a switch on Fortnite to ‚Äúall bot lobby‚Äù mode. But there are ways to tilt matchmaking in your favor and get games with more bots and fewer sweats. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tested:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Brand-new accounts:</b> A fresh account tends to get easier matches‚Äîbut you start from scratch, lose skins, and risk bans if Epic detects abuse.</li>
  <li><b>Playing at strange hours:</b> Sometimes queueing during off-peak times (early AM in your region) can pair you with fewer, less skilled players.</li>
  <li><b>Dropping in less popular locations:</b> This lowers your chances of early fights‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt guarantee bots.</li>
  <li><b>Using a VPN to change your region:</b> This can work, but most VPNs slow down your connection significantly, causing lag or disconnects on PS5.</li>
  <li><b>Playing public team modes with friends who are new or low-ranked:</b> Sometimes helps, sometimes not‚Äîbecause the matchmaking system looks at all players in the squad.</li>
  <li><b>Private matches with bots:</b> Good for practice, but no real XP, no progression, and no fun against human players.</li>
  <li><b>Selective routing VPN (split-tunneling):</b> <b>This is the secret sauce.</b> You route only Fortnite‚Äôs matchmaking data through a VPN in a low-competition region, while keeping other traffic local. No lag, just easier lobbies.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last option is exactly what EzLobbies by SlothyTech offers. No complicated setup, no risk to your Epic account, and no compromises on connectivity.</p>

<h2>What Do We Mean by ‚ÄúBot Lobby‚Äù in Fortnite PS5?</h2>
<p>Important to clarify: a ‚Äúbot lobby‚Äù in Fortnite rarely means every player is an AI bot. Instead, it‚Äôs a mix of Epic‚Äôs AI-controlled bots <i>plus</i> a high number of casual or lower-skill human players. These less experienced players typically miss shots, don‚Äôt build to full potential, or don‚Äôt use advanced strategies.</p>
<p>So when people say ‚Äúbot‚Äù online, they often mean easy targets rather than literal AI. The matchmaking system intentionally adds bots in low-queue or low-skill scenarios to keep matches populated and enjoyable.</p>

<h2>How EzLobbies Works for Fortnite PS5 (Simplified)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Fortnite and a target country with historically lower player competition (places like Vietnam, Kenya, or some Latin American countries work well).</li>
  <li>Select a VPN server from NordVPN located in that country via the EzLobbies site.</li>
  <li>EzLobbies creates a custom VPN configuration that routes <i>only</i> Fortnite‚Äôs matchmaking traffic through that VPN server.</li>
  <li>Import this configuration into a VPN client on your router or compatible device that services your PS5 network.</li>
  <li>Connect using your VPN credentials, launch Fortnite, and queue as usual.</li>
  <li>The result: matchmaking sees you as if you‚Äôre in the target region, placing you in easier lobbies with more bots and casual players‚Äîwhile your general internet stays fast since only game traffic is tunneled.</li>
</ol>

<h2>My Actual Results Using EzLobbies on Fortnite PS5</h2>
<p>I tested EzLobbies several times, and here‚Äôs what I saw:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dropped the VPN config for Vietnam at 2am local time and queued in Solo mode.</li>
  <li>First matches had many players who barely built and missed simple shots.</li>
  <li>At least 50% of opponents seemed to be Epic‚Äôs AI bots‚Äînoticeably slower, running straight into fights, and very predictable.</li>
  <li>Capped off challenges and XP much faster than usual, without sweating every fight.</li>
  <li>Switched servers occasionally (try Kenya and Peru) to keep the lobby mix fresh.</li>
  <li>Back home without VPN? Instantly the frantic building and sweatier players returned.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Connection quality?</b> No noticeable lag or disconnects. The setup kept regular internet traffic on my local connection, so streaming and voice chat were unaffected.</p>

<h2>FAQ: Common Questions About Fortnite PS5 Bot Lobbies</h2>
<ul>

  No. This doesn‚Äôt modify the game or exploit bugs. You‚Äôre simply connecting from a different region, which is allowed (like playing while traveling).</li>
  <li><b>Will my ping get worse?</b><br>
  Nope! Because only matchmaking traffic is routed through the VPN server close to the target region, your overall connection remains strong.</li>

  PS5 itself doesn‚Äôt support custom VPN apps, but you can set up your router or a PC to route traffic via OpenVPN for your console.</li>
  <li><b>Can it work for other platforms?</b><br>
  Absolutely! The same method applies to PC, Xbox, or even mobile Fortnite.</li>
  <li><b>Is there a free way to do this?</b><br>
  Free VPNs are usually too slow or unreliable, causing lag or connection loss. EzLobbies paired with a reputable VPN like NordVPN is your best bet.</li>
</ul>
